###Author: Federico Navarro

This Codebook is part of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The Project involves using data from SmartLab.
The Readme.txt file contains the link to download the data from the Machine Learning Repository. 

SmartLab conducted an experiment in which 30 people performed six different activities: walking, walking upstairs,
walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. During the activities, data was collected using the Smartphone's 
accelerometer and Gyroscope. SmartLab divided the data collected into two different datasets: train and test. The train
dataset contains 70% of the observations randomly partitioned. The goal of this project is to obtain, clean and merge
the train and test sets producing a tidy data and a summarized report. 

In the data set, each observation contains the triaxal accelaration and estimated body acceleration, triaxal angular
velocity from the gyroscope,time and frequency domain variables, the activity label and a subject identifier. For 
the values obtain SmartLab also calculated the mean, the standard deviation, the median, the maximum and minimum, the 
signal magnitude area, an energy measure, the interquartile range, signal entropy, an autorregresion coefficients, 
correlation coeficcient between two signals, and index of the frecuency component with largest magnitude, a weighted
average of hte frequency components to obtain a mean frequency, the skewness of the frequency domain, the kurtosis
of the frequency domain, an energy of a frequency interval and the angle between vectors. 

In this project, both train and test datasets were cleaned to extract the variables that contain the mean and standard 
deviation of the values. Furthermore the activity and subject labels were added to each dataset. In addition, the variable
labels were renamed to be descriptive and the test and train sets were merged. Finally, a tidy dataset summary was created 
by each subject and activity. The script to perform this transformations can be found in the file run_analysis.r
